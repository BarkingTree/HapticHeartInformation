          <p class="lead mb-5">Haptic heart is an iOS application that generates patterns of vibration (Haptics) designed to mimic the human heartbeat and assorted pathological sounds. 
            These patterns are created dynamically and various murmurs or additional heart sounds can be combined and explored at different heart rates. Its purpose 
            is to act as a training tool allowing students to improve their skills at cardiovascular auscultation.

            <h4 class="mb-0">Overview</h4>   
            <p>We would like to invite you to take part in a research study. Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done 
                    and what it will involve. Please take time to read this information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish.  Ask us anything that is not clear.  </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">Why have I been invited to take part?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">You have been invited to participate in this study as you are a medical student from a relevant cohort currently engaged in learning cardiology and are part of 
                the relevant target audience for the use of the app. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">What is the purpose of the research?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This study seeks to explore the student perception of using Haptic Heart, a new app-based cardiology teaching tool 
                  that uses haptics to enhance student learning. </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">Do I have to take part?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">No. It is up to you to decide if you want to take part in this research.  We will describe the study and go through this information sheet with you to answer any questions you may 
                    have.  If you agree to participate, we will ask you to sign a consent form and will give you a copy to keep.  However, you would still be free to withdraw from the study at any time, without 
                    giving a reason and without any negative consequences, by advising the researchers of this decision.  This would not affect your legal rights. If you are a student at the University of Lincoln, 
                    there would be no disadvantages to your study or to you personally if you decide not to take part in this study, or if you decide to withdraw at any point. </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">What will happen to me if I take part?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">You will be given access to a demonstration version of the Haptic Heart App. If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete a short online consent form and then a short 
                    questionnaire to describe your experiences with the software. This should take no more than a few minutes and can be completed online at your convenience.  </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">Are there any benefits in taking part?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Whilst Haptic Heart is a new program we hope that it will offer some benefits in developing your skills in assessing heart murmurs. You will be given access to this 
                    regardless of if you take part in the study.  </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">What happens to the data provided?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">All consent and questionnaire data will be held on a university server. No data will be transferred outside this. The questionnaire results will be reviewed and used to give insight into the use of haptic heart and
                     inform the design of future research projects. All research data and records will be stored for a minimum of 7 years after publication or public release of the work of the research.  </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">What will happen if I dont want to carry on with the study?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Even after you have signed the consent form, you are free to withdraw from the study at any time without giving any reason and without your legal rights being affected. Any personal data will be destroyed.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">Who will know that I am taking part in this research?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">All information collected about you during this research would be handled in confidence.  All such data are kept on password-protected databases sitting on a restricted access computer system and any paper information (such as your consent form, contact details and any research questionnaires) 
                would be stored safely in lockable cabinets in a swipe-card secured building and would only be accessed by the research team.

                </p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">What will happen to the results of the research?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4"> The research will be used to inform he design of future research projects using this or similar systems and may be submitted for publication in relevant journals or at conferences.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-0">Who has reviewed this study?</h4>
            <p class="mb-4"> All research involving people is looked at by an independent group of people, called a Research Ethics Committee, to protect your interests.
